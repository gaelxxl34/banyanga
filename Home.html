            Walikale is a town in the North Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It is the administrative center of the Walikale Territory.

            Walikale is home to the largest tin deposits in 
            the Congo and to some very large gold mines, as 
            well. In particular, the Bisie mine is supposed 
            to account for somewhere between 50 and 80% of t
            in exports from North Kivu. The control of Bisie 
            mine is a main source of contention within the 
            Congolese army, as it provides for upwards of 
            $100,000 a month in taxes for local soldiers. 
            This does not include the individual pits that 
            some commanders control and or the kickbacks 
            they get from trading houses.
